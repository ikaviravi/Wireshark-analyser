**Protocols Identified:**
1. UDP - User Datagram protocol (used to send messages to other host)
2. DNS - Domain Name System (used to resolve domain names)
3. TCP - Transmission Control Protocol (reliable transport layer protocol)

**Observations:**
- UDP possibly related to VPN like WireGuard.
- DNS queries seen for resolving domain names.
- TCP packets were visible throughout the session establishing connections.

**Tools Used:** Wireshark vX.X
**File:** capture.pcap
